void _0xB1BB03742917A5D6(int type, float xPos, float yPos, float zPos, float p4, int red, int green, int blue, int alpha);
```

```
12 matches across 4 scripts. All 4 scripts were job creators.  
type ranged from 0 - 2.  
p4 was always 0.2f. Likely scale.  
assuming p5 - p8 is RGBA, the graphic is always yellow (255, 255, 0, 255).  
Tested but noticed nothing.
