## SET_BLIP_SPRITE

```c
// 0xDF735600A4696DAF 0x8DBBB0B9
void SET_BLIP_SPRITE(Blip blip, int spriteId);
```

```
Takes a blip object and adds a sprite to it on the map.  
You may have your own list, but since dev-c didn't show it I was bored and started looking through scripts and functions to get a presumable almost positive list of a majority of blip IDs
