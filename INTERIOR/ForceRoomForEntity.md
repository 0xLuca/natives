## FORCE_ROOM_FOR_ENTITY

```c
// 0x52923C4710DD9907 0x10BD4435
void FORCE_ROOM_FOR_ENTITY(Entity entity, int interiorID, Hash roomHashKey);
```

```
Does anyone know what this does? I know online modding isn't generally supported especially by the owner of this db, but I first thought this could be used to force ourselves into someones apartment, but I see now that isn't possible.  
```

## Parameters
* **entity**: 
* **interiorID**: 
* **roomHashKey**:
