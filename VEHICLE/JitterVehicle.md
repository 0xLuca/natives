## _JITTER_VEHICLE

```c
// 0xC59872A5134879C7 0x4A46E814
void _JITTER_VEHICLE(Vehicle vehicle, BOOL p1, float yaw, float pitch, float roll);
```

```
When I called this with what the script was doing, which was -190f for yaw pitch and roll, all my car did was jitter a little. I also tried 0 and 190f. I altered the p1 variable between TRUE and FALSE and didn't see a difference.  
This might have something to do with the physbox of the vehicle, but I'm not sure.  
```

## Parameters
* **vehicle**: 
* **p1**: 
* **yaw**: 
* **pitch**: 
* **roll**:
